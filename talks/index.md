I'm rather late to party (this super amazing R guy Karl Broman has [archived talks going back to 1998!](http://kbroman.org/pages/talks.html), but going forward I'm going to try to archive all my talks. This ends up being especially useful when math and code gets woven into talks, since no one ever has time to comprehend or write all that stuff down. Anyway, you don't want to see my dumpster fire grad student talks anyhow. I do probably have most/some of the ones from late grad school / postdoc, so I might resurrect them.
