I am currently appointed as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Sociology and Work Science, at University of Gothenburg, Sweden, and as a visiting scholar at the Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, the US. 

My research is currently being funded by the [Swedish Research Council](http://www.vr.se/) within its International Postdoc Programme. I am entitled to be abroad for two of the three years of what the funding covers. My project is about the *Impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis on Child Poverty in Developing Countries*.
