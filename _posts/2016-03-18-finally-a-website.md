I will note my original inspiration was a pelican blog style after April Wright's website which I intended to crib as much from as possible, but alas I couldn't figure it out as quickly as I wanted, so I gave up and went with Jekyll and the minimal mistakes style that Sam Scarpino is using for his website.
