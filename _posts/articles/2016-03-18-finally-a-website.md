Well, here begins my attempts to carve out a website. I will note my original inspiration was a pelican blog style after [April Wright's](      http://wrightaprilm.github.io/) website which I intended to crib as much from as possible, but alas I couldn't figure it out as quickly as I wanted, so I gave up and went with Jekyll and the minimal mistakes style that [Sam Scarpino](http://scarpino.github.io/) is using for his website.
