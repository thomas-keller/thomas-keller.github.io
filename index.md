Hi! I recently moved to the Tampa Bay Area.

I have a Ph.D. with a background in bioinformatics first studying bacterial and viral genomes during graduate school before switching to evolutionary epigenetics for post-graduate work. 

I have touched on many evolutionary topics during my academic training, and I'm looking to use the computational skills I picked up along the way in some bioinformatics or data science roles.

I am actively seeking opportunities in the Tampa, Florida region. Specific job sectors of interest include biotechnology, health care, and data science.

All pictures on this website were taken by me. You can follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thomas.e.keller/) if you're into that kind of thing!
