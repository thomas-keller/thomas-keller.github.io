Hi! I recently moved to the Tampa Bay Area.

I have a Ph.D. with a background in bioinformatics first studying bacterial and viral genomes during graduate school before switching to evolutionary epigenetics for post-graduate work.

I am actively seeking opportunities in the Tampa, Florida region. Specific job sectors of interest include biotechnology, health care, and data science.
