I recently finished a postdoctoral study with Dr. Soojin Yi at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying evolutionary epigenetics. Prior to that I completed my Ph.D at the university of Texas at Austin and was co-advised by Dr. James J. Bull (i.e. Jim) and Claus O. Wilke. I can honestly say that I have been incredibly humbled to have worked with these great scholars through my graduate and post-doctorate training.
